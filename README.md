# Introduction
Prismcube Ruby was made by the Korean manufacture Marusys which also makes the Vu+ receivers.

The Prismcube Ruby was sold in Europe by Ab-Com under the name AB IPBox Prismcube Ruby. In the Middle East the same receiver is sold under the name PRISMCUBE KASYS by KASYS International we have also seen an Openbox branded version.

The Prismcube was not an Enigma2 based receiver like most of the stb in the market. It is the first to come with XBMC. XBMC Media Center is an award-winning free and open source cross-platform software media player and entertainment hub for digital media. So the Prismcube is something new representing XBMC4STB an entirely new platform and it will be interesting to see if it can compete with Enigma2.

Prismcube Ruby was a satellite tv only receiver with twin fixed DVB-S2 tuners. The hardware is pretty basic which also is reflected in the price. We are not talking high end here.
